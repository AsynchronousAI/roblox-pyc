# template
Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.3.0. Modified template
for roblox-pyc.


## Getting Started
To compile the `/src` folder, use:
```bash
rpyc .
# Quickly compiles all files in the source folder to the compiled folder.
```
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "template.rbxlx"
# Generates a place file from the compiled folder.
```

Next, open `template.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
