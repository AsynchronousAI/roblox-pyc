## TODO:
Contributions would be greatly appreciated!

## Far future
- More built in libraries
- Playground

## Add later
- Fix random `nonlocals` error, line 320 robloxpy.py
- Python speed improvements, currently takes like 10 minutes to compile 400 scripts
- Add mixed-language support for roblox-pyc which will be general, and robloxts wrapper included.
- Loading bar has weird duplication bug when Compile Errors are present
- Remaster text colorings
- Update docs

## Big
- Add return getfenv() or something like that to the end of pip packages and someway of import * 
- Dual directory compilation (one directory for target lang, one more for source lang). Thinking of using `d` command for this

## Post-release
- Enable C/C++ and add loader for install and uninstall
- Fix dylib config not saving after using C or C++ compiler
