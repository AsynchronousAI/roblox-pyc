## TODO:
Contributions would be greatly appreciated!

## Other repos
- More built in libraries
- Playground

## Add later
- Fix dylib config not saving after using C or C++ compiler 
- Fix random `nonlocals` error, line 320 robloxpy.py
- Python speed improvements, currently takes like 10 minutes to compile 400 scripts

## IMPORTANT!! But can wait
- Add return getfenv() or something like that to the end of pip packages and someway of import * 
- Dual directory compilation (one directory for target lang, one more for source lang). Thinking of using `d` command for this
- Enable C/C++ and add loader for install and uninstall
