## Guide
### #1 - Clone and start server
In the terminal write the following
```
git clone https://github.com/AsynchronousAI/roblox.py/; cd roblox.py; python .
```

> Note: This process will end whenever you restart your computer or close the terminal. We recommend using Replit instead.

If any issues occur here report it in github issues.

### #2 - Download client
A download link is in the releases, download the file and place it in your plugins folder. 

You can check where your plugins folder is by:
- opening Roblox Studio
- clicking the Plugins folder icon in the top bar
- and clicking "Plugins Folder"

### #3 Configuring the client
After installing the client open any place, make a new StringValue anywhere named "ROBLOXPY_CONFIG" with its value being the url and then press the roblox.py/Python icon in the plugins tab.

> Note: If you are hosting on a personal computer this step may not be needed because the url is defaulted to localhost:5555

### #4 Open studio and test
Open Roblox Studio, and select any location and click the roblox.py/Python icon in the plugins tab. A window for editing the plugin and a new script named "Script.py" should appear in the explorer.
